# Consumer Goods Ad-hoc Insights


This project involved conducting a detailed analysis for Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) , a leading producer of computer hardware in India, which has also expanded its operations to various countries globally.

The management realized they were lacking the necessary insights to make quick, data-driven decisions. To address this, they decided to expand their data analytics team by hiring several junior analysts. Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, aimed to find candidates proficient in both technical and soft skills, leading him to design a SQL challenge to evaluate these capabilities.

In this project, I used MySQL for data querying and manipulation, and Power BI to create clear and effective visualizations.
